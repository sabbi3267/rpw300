This memo is a request to change the meeting location from coaster. First I discuss the disadvantages of meeting at coasters and then the advantages of moving along with some suggestions.

Civil Engineering Associates is a very reputable organization. In future it has the potential to grow and have more members. For growth and better exposure to new members we need to consider a different location for the meeting.

Disadvantages 
Currently the meetings at coasters is holding us from communicating with each other rather be distracted with young waitresses.
Women will feel uncomfortable in such places. We definitely want more women in the engineering. Since the male women ration has been different in the past years
Does provide exposure to new members

Advantages of changing:
Will give us more time to talk with each other, bond and starting new ideas.
All members will feel comfortable.
Will give us more exposure to new members.

Other options:
Sports bar, where we can watch a game and talk about new ideas.
Cook out, would be a  great way to collaborate and bond as a team.
