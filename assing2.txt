This memo is a request to change the meeting location from coaster. First I discuss the disadvantages of meeting at coasters and then the advantages of moving along with some suggestions.

Civil Engineering Associates is a very reputable organization. In future it has the potential to grow and have more members. For growth and better exposure to new members we need to consider a different location for the meeting.

Disadvantages 
Currently the meetings at coasters is holding us from communicating with each other rather be distracted with young waitresses.
It puts women members in a bad situation
Does provide exposure to new members

Advantages of changing:
Will give us more time to talk with each other, bond and starting new ideas.
All members will feel comfortable.
Will give us more exposure to new members.

Other options:
Sports bar, where we can watch a game and talk about new ideas.
Cook out, would be a  great way to collaborate and bond as a team.
