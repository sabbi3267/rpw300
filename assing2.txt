This memo is a request to change the meeting location from coaster. First I discuss the disadvantages of meeting at coasters and then the advantages of moving along with some suggestions.

Civil Engineering Associates is a very reputable organization. In future it has the potential to grow and have more members. For growth and better exposure to new members we need to consider a different location for the meeting.

Disadvantages 
1.Currently the meetings at coasters is holding us from communicating with each other rather be distracted with provocative young waitresses.
2.Women will feel uncomfortable in such places. We definitely want more women in the engineering. Since the male women ration has been different in the past years. There are more women coming into civil engineering. So we need to consider their comfort and ease.
3.Although Coaster is a prominent place for men. If we want to attract younger female and male engineers to join the association is not the best place.

Advantages of changing:
1.Will give us more time to talk with each other, bond and starting new ideas.
2.All members will feel comfortable.
3.Will give us more exposure to new members.

Other options:
Sports bar, where we can watch a game and talk about new ideas.
Cook out, would be a  great way to collaborate and bond as a team.

Final Line:
I have completed the assignment without any help of others.
