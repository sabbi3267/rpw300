The report offer a satisfactory description of the accident. The report provides the prescenario and how the pipeline works. The illustrations and the maps it helps visualize where the rupture was in the pipeline. 

The report offer clear and convincing evidence of the causes of the accident that the rupture was due to the exposure of the pipeline in the wetdry area with near neutral pH caused corrosion. Also reported the wall thickness was not proper to protect from continuos pressure.

The report doesnot quite  make a persuasive case for changes or materials to improve safety. There was not enough evidence to suppor the changes will make the improvement.
